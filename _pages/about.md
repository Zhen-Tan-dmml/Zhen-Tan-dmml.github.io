![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/image_to_text_vis.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year Ph.D. at the [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). Previously, I received my master's and bachelor's degrees from [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) and [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/), respectively. 

🔬 My research spans **human-centered AI**, **explainable and interpretable machine learning**, **foundation models**, and **trustworthy AI systems**. I study the foundations of explainability, including intrinsic limits such as the simplicity paradox and faithfulness, as well as user-centric explanations for alignment, safety, and security. I further develop actionable explainability, designing methods where explanations actively guide model reasoning, agent decision-making, and human–AI interaction. A core part of my work focuses on **interdisciplinary impact**, creating explainable and reliable AI algorithms that advance applications in healthcare, computational bioinformatics, social science, and robotics.

<!-- # Experience -->

<!-- ## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I work on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content. -->
